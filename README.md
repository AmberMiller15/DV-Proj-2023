## Purpose
### Topic and Rationale
The intent of this project is to understand traffic accidents in the US.  We will explore correlations in the data to understand factors that contribute to accidents such as the vehicles involved, the weather, and the location of the incidents. Using this analysis we hope to understand the factors that lead to the most severe accidents for the purpose sharing information that helps drivers to avoid the worst accidents. 


## Approach
### Data Sources
We plan to use National Highway Trafffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) 2019 Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS). The CRSS is a sample of police-reported crashes that include: motor vehiclees, pedestrians, and even cyclists. This data is sampled from roughly 5-6 million police reports from 60 different geographic areas across the United States. (https://www.nhtsa.gov/crash-data-systems/crash-report-sampling-system)

### Database Structure



### Machine Learning Model
The objective of the Machine Learning model is [to determine what factors best predict a serious accident]. We use a [Classification] model rather than Regression because our target variable is discrete.
