## Purpose
### Topic and Rationale
The intent of this project is to understand traffic accidents in the US.  We will explore correlations in the data to understand factors that contribute to accidents such as the vehicles involved, the weather, and the location of the incidents. Using this analysis we hope to understand the factors that lead to the most severe accidents for the purpose of sharing information that helps drivers to avoid the worst accidents. 

The intent for this project is to understand how vehicle body types can determine the serverity of accidents in the US. We plan to explore the correlations that contribute to accidents that we've segmented into driver, external, and road factors:

    - Driver factors: was there alcohol involved, did the driver have a trailor attached, etc?
    - External factors: Time of day (day/night), week, month, weather conditions.
    - Road factors: speed limit, zoning, location on road. 
 
## Approach
### Data Sources
We plan to use National Highway Trafffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) 2019 Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS). The CRSS is a sample of police-reported crashes that include: motor vehicles, pedestrians, and even cyclists. This data is sampled from roughly 5-6 million police reports from 60 different geographic areas across the United States. (https://www.nhtsa.gov/crash-data-systems/crash-report-sampling-system)

### Database Structure



### Machine Learning Model
The objective of the Machine Learning model is [to determine what factors best predict a serious accident]. We use a [Classification] model rather than Regression because our target variable is discrete.
