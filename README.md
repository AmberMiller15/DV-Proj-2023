## Purpose
### Topic and Rationale
The intent of this project is to understand traffic accidents in the US.  We will explore correlations in the data to understand factors that contribute to accidents such as the vehicles involved, the drivers, and the location of the incidents. Using this analysis we hope to answer the age old question: What state has the worst drivers? Our rationale for exploring this analysis is to finally resolve this long-debated topic by using data to provide a clear answer.
